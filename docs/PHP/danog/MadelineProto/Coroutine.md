Creates a promise from a generator function yielding promises.  

When a promise is yielded, execution of the generator is interrupted until the promise is resolved. A success
value is sent into the generator, while a failure reason is thrown into the generator. Using a coroutine,
asynchronous code can be written without callbacks and be structured like synchronous code.


## Method list:
* `fail(\Throwable $reason)`
* `offsetGet(mixed $offset)`
* `getTrace()`
* `getFrame()`
* `jsonSerialize()`
* `onResolve()`

## Methods:
### `fail(\Throwable $reason)`




Parameters:

* `$reason`: `\Throwable` Failure reason.  


#### See also: 
* `\Throwable`




### `offsetGet(mixed $offset)`

Get data at an array offset asynchronously.


Parameters:

* `$offset`: `mixed` Offset  



### `getTrace()`

Get current stack trace for running coroutine.



### `getFrame()`

Get current execution frame.



### `jsonSerialize()`

Obtain.



### `onResolve()`
